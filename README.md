# Simon Game

Welcome to my Simon game project! This is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Game Description

The Simon game is a memory game where the player must repeat a sequence of colors and sounds generated by the game. The sequence starts with a single color and progressively increases in length as the player successfully replicates it. The game continues until the player makes a mistake or chooses to stop.

## Demo

To see the Simon game in action, you can visit the live demo [here](https://shreeyash01.github.io/Simon-Game/).

## Installation

To run the Simon game locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Shreeyash01/Simon-Game.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd simon-game
```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## How to Play

1. When you start the game, you will see four colored buttons: green, red, yellow, and blue.

2. Watch and listen to the pattern of lights and sounds played by the game.

3. Repeat the pattern by clicking on the buttons in the correct order.

4. If you repeat the pattern correctly, the game will add another step to the sequence.

5. Keep repeating the patterns as the game gets more challenging. Try to beat your high score!
